Wolfgang Bangerth is a professor of mathematics and, by courtesy, geosciences at Colorado State University. He studied physics and mathematics at the University of Stuttgart and the University of Heidelberg in Germany. Following a few months at the ETH Zurich in Switzerland, he was a postdoc at the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES, now the Oden Institute) and the Institute for Geophyics at the University of Texas at Austin, and starting in 2005 on the faculty of the Department of Mathematics of Texas A&M University. He has been at Colorado State University since 2016. During his PhD time in Heidelberg, Wolfgang started the deal.II finite element library, a library that by now has more than a million lines of C++ and is the basis for at least 1,600 publications in nearly all areas of the sciences and engineering. He is also a founding Principal Developer of the ASPECT code that is widely used in the simulation of convection in the Earth mantle as well as for long-term deformation in the crust.
