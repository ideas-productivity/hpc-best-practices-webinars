Balint Joo got his B. Sc. in Computer Science and Physics in 1996 and his PhD in Theoretical Physics in 2000, both at the University of Edinburgh. Since then he has been working in the area of numerical lattice QCD calculations, with post doctoral positions at the University of Kentucky working on Monte Carlo algorithms, at Columbia University and the University of Edinburgh as part of the design team for the QCDOC supercomputer, and back at the University of Edinburgh where he worked with solvers for Chiral Fermions and got involved with the QDP++ and Chroma software packages. He has been a Staff Computer Scientist at Jefferson Lab since 2005, where his work includes maintaining and developing Chroma and porting and optimizing it for new architectures. He has been working closely with NVIDIA on the QUDA library and more recently with Intel on code for Xeon and Xeon Phi. He is also a computer user running lattice QCD calculations on a number of DOE and NSF centers including Titan at OLCF, BlueWaters at NCSA and Stampede at TACC.
