Dr. Thompson earned his undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering at University College, Dublin, Ireland. He earned his Ph.D in Chemical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, 1994 in the area of statistical thermodynamics of complex fluids. Since 1997 he has worked in the Center for Computing Research at Sandia National Laboratories, first as a post-doctoral appointee, and since 2002 as principal member of the technical staff. Throughout that time he has worked as one of the core developers of the LAMMPS molecular dynamics code, while at the same time using it to study the atomic-to-mesoscale behavior of a wide variety of materials, described in over 50 publications. In recent years, frustrated with the limited accuracy of classical potentials, he has become a leading developer of machine-learned interatomic potentials fit to large databases of quantum calculations.
