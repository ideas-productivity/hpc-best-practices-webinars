David M. Rogers is a computational scientist in the National Center for Computational Sciences Division at ORNL, where he works to develop mathematical and computational theory jointly with methods for multiscale modeling using HPC. He obtained his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from University of Cincinnati in 2009 where he worked on applying Bayesâ€™ theorem to the free energy problem with applications to multiscale modeling of fluids and interface chemistry. After a Post-doctoral fellowship at Sandia National Labs working on modeling of desalination and ion conduction, he served as Assistant Professor of Chemistry from 2013-2019. Over that time, he has published over a range of topics including statistical mechanical methods in liquids, biomolecules, and quantum models, small nonequilibrium systems, hydration, and finite-size effects in nanoscale devices.
