Shoaib Sufi (<Shoaib.Sufi@manchester.ac.uk>) leads the Software
Sustainability Institute's community engagement activities and
strategies. Graduating in Computer Science from the University of
Manchester in 1997, he has worked in the commercial sector as a
systems programmer and then as a software developer, metadata
architect and eventually a project manager at the Science and
Facilities Technologies Council (STFC).
 
Shoaib has specific interest in building, managing and sustaining
high-performance teams, distributed agile project management and the
promotion of technical best practice in software products for use in
research. He is a project manager by practice and training (holding a
PMI PMP), and also serves in this capacity with the eScience Lab at
the University of Manchester.
 
His work at the Institute includes coordinating its Fellowship
Programme, a network of researchers who act as ambassadors of better
research software practice to their domains and organisations by
organising workshops related to research software and attending
relevant workshops and conferences in their areas of work. Shoaib also
leads the Institute's annual Collaborations Workshop(CW) which brings
together researchers, developers, funders, managers and more to
explore hot topics in research software all within an engaging
unconference inspired format.
