Mike Heroux (<maherou@sandia.gov>) is a Senior Scientist at Sandia
National Laboratories, Director of SW Technologies for the US DOE
Exascale Computing Project (ECP) and Scientist in Residence at
St. John’s University, MN. His research interests include all aspects
of scalable scientific and engineering software for new and emerging
parallel computing architectures.

He leads several projects in this field: ECP SW Technologies is an
integrated effort to provide the software stack for ECP. The Trilinos
Project (2004 R&D 100 winner) is an effort to provide reusable,
scalable scientific software components. The Mantevo Project (2013 R&D
100 winner) is focused on the development of open source, portable
mini-applications and mini-drivers for the co-design of future
supercomputers and applications. HPCG is an official TOP 500 benchmark
for ranking computer systems, complementing LINPACK.

Mike’s most recent interests are focused on improving scientific
software developer productivity and software sustainability. He leads
the IDEAS project, dedicated to engaging scientific software teams to
identify and adopt practices that improve productivity and
sustainability.

Mike is a Fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics
(SIAM), a Distinguished Member of the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM), and a Senior Member of IEEE. He has been
Editor-in-Chief for the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software
(2011 - 2016), Subject Area Editor for the Journal on Parallel and
Distributed Computing (2012 - 2016) and Associate Editor for the SIAM
Journal on Scientific Computing (2010 - 2015). He is a past chair of
the SIAM Activity Group on Supercomputing and is presently a member of
the Supercomputing Conference series steering committee, focusing
particularly on improving reproducibility in computational
science. Mike is also part of an [NISO committee on Reproducibility
Badging](https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2019/01/new-niso-project-badging-scheme-reproducibility-computational-and-computing).

Mike works remotely for Sandia, maintaining an office at home in rural
central Minnesota and at St. John’s University in the Computer Science
Department.
