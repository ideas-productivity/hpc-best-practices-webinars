Roscoe A. Bartlett earned his PhD in chemical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University researching numerical approaches for solving large-scale constrained optimization problems applied to chemical process engineering. At Sandia National Laboratories and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, he continued research and development in constrained optimization, sensitivity methods, and large-scale numerical software design and integration for computational science & engineering (CSE). Dr. Bartlett currently focuses on software engineering challenges in CSE as well as the development of build, test, and integration software and processes for CSE.
