Rahulkumar (Rahul) Gayatri is an Application Performance Specialist at NERSC, LBNL. He is an HPC engineer and works closely with the application development teams to optimize compute intensive kernels in their code for future generation architectures. He is currently working with the LAMMPS team in the EXAALT ECP project to optimize the SNAP module for NVIDIA GPUs. He is also interested in testing the efficiency of OpenMP target directives as a paradigm to offload kernels onto GPUs. Rahul obtained his PhD in the field of Parallel Programming Models from Barcelona Supercomputing Center. His research focus was on speculative task execution in OMPSs, a task based programming model.
