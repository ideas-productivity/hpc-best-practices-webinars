Esteban Rangel is a member of the HACC development team. He joined the Computational Science (CPS) division at Argonne National Laboratory as an Assistant Computational Scientist in 2021. Prior to joining CPS, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) working on porting HACCâ€™s hydrodynamics solvers to the Aurora supercomputer. He began contributing to the HACC codebase as a Ph.D. student at Northwestern University, where much of the work towards his thesis was designing and implementing scalable analysis software for N-body cosmological simulations.
