Sorrel Harriet is currently a lecturer at Leeds Trinity University where she leads their undergraduate computer science program. Sorrel was awarded the SSI Fellowship in 2019 and has since been carrying out research exploring software development processes and organisational structures in the academic research context. She is particularly interested in the applicability of socio-technical systems (STS) theory to the academic research context. In collaboration with other SSI fellows, Sorrel is looking to establish a community coaching initiative for academics and RSEs involved with research software development.
