Matt Belhorn is an HPC support specialist,
providing technical support and training to researchers employing the
OLCF’s leadership-class public research compute resources. Matt has a
research background in experimental high-energy particle physics. He
was a long-time collaborator of the Belle and BelleII CP-violation
experiments located at the Japanese High-Energy Accelerator Research
Organization (KEK). His research efforts include contributions to the
design and construction of BelleII’s Imaging Time-of-Propagation
(iTOP) counter. Matt developed his interest in high-performance
computing while analyzing the physics of spontaneous
particle-antiparticle oscillations.
