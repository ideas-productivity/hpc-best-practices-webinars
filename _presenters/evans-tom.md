Thomas Evans works in the development,
implementation, and application of computational radiation transport
in nuclear engineering, radiation detection, astrophysics, high energy
density physics, and medical applications.  His interests include
stochastic and deterministic transport methods on massively parallel
platforms, nonlinear and time-dependent transport methods, coupled
physics including radiation-hydrodynamics and core-reactor physics,
acceleration and preconditioning techniques, optimization and
performance analysis, and large-scale scientific software design for
parallel codes.  He has published over 90 refereed journal and
conference articles on highly parallel stochastic and deterministic
transport methods, coupled physics including radiation-hydrodynamics
and core-reactor physics, acceleration and preconditioning techniques,
etc. He is the primary developer of the Denovo parallel deterministic
and Shift Monte Carlo transport codes at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. He is currently a PI and Focus Area Deputy in Radiation
Transport for the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water
Reactors Energy Innovation Hub at Oak Ridge. He is also the PI for the
Coupled Monte Carlo Neutronics and Fluid Flow Simulation of Small
Modular Reactors (ExaSMR) Exascale Application Project (ECP).
