Dr. Thomas Clune (<thomas.l.clune@nasa.gov>) currently serves as the
Lead for the Software Integration Team within the Global Modeling and
Assimilation Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and also as
NASA's representative on the Fortran Standards Committee.  Much of his
recent activities have been focused on leveraging object-oriented
features of modern Fortran to provide Fortran developers with analogs
of useful capabilities available in other software communities.  His
open source projects include pFUnit (parallel unit testing for
Fortran), gFTL (poor-man's container templates for Fortran), fArgParse
(command line processing), and pFlogger (an MPI-enhanced analog of
Python’s logging package).
