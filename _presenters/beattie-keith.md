Keith Beattie is a computer systems engineer at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) with experience in bringing modern, open-source software engineering practices to academic and research contexts. His interests are in understanding and addressing the unique challenges in leading multi-institutional, geographically dispersed scientific software development teams while still producing effective and usable software, particularly teams composed of members from scientific but not necessarily software engineering backgrounds. He has worked in industry as a software engineer and release manager and has been at LBNL for the past 20 years. He also tortures local music venue attendees playing bass in rock bands.
