Gerasimos Chourdakis is a doctoral candidate at the Technical University of Munich, working on transforming the preCICE project from an “as-is” coupling library into a “batteries included” multiphysics ecosystem. With this perspective, he takes the leading role in organizing the development and operations of the “flesh” of the preCICE ecosystem, including adapters for various solvers, tutorial cases, documentation, website, and testing, shaping these components for the preCICE community to grow upon. He is also researching methods for geometric multiscale coupling and enjoys teaching topics related to research software engineering.
