David Bernholdt is a Distinguished R&D Staff Member in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  His research interests, broadly speaking, are in making it easier and more productive to develop and use scientific software, particularly on high-performance computers.  This includes work in programming models and programming languages, software design, software engineering, and related areas.  He began his scientific career as a computational scientist before transitioning to a focus on computer science topics and has continued to work with computational science and engineering projects in various domains throughout his career to “ground” his other research.

David has leadership roles in multiple projects in ECP and the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program, and he leads the Programming Environment and Tools area for the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF).  He has served as the ORNL PI and Outreach Lead for both the IDEAS-Classic and IDEAS-ECP projects and is now active in several software stewardship projects under the developing DOE/ASCR Next-Generation Scientific Software Technologies (NGSST) program.
