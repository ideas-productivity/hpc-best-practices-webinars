Piotr Luszczek is a Research Assistant Professor in the Tickle College of Engineering at the University of Tennessee and a member of the Innovative Computing Laboratory with a long record of research and software development spanning benchmarking, numerical linear algebra for high-performance computing, automatic performance tuning for hardware accelerators, and stochastic models for performance. His mixed-precision work goes back over 15 years to a new look at mixed-precision iterative refinement that is now implemented in modern numerical linear algebra libraries. He contributed to inner-outer iteration research that also exploited performance of lower-precision floating-point arithmetic. More recently, he used autotuning across multiple precisions and introduced a new factorization algorithm with scaling that maintains improved accuracy for reduced-precision computations. Currently, Piotr serves as a co-PI for the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) xSDK project that has as one of its main thrusts the goal of introducing mixed-precision approaches to the world-class software of the Exascale machines.

<!-- Bio from webinar 35 -->
Piotr Luszczek is a research assistant professor at the Innovative
Computing Laboratory in the University of Tennessee. Piotr earned his
Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville. His research interests include benchmarking, numerical
linear algebra for high-performance computing, automatic performance
tuning, and stochastic performance models. He has over a decade of
experience developing HPC numerical software for large-scale,
distributed-memory multicore systems with hardware accelerators. Piotr
serves as a co-PI on the ECP xSDK project that aims to improve access
to world-class software on exascale machines.
