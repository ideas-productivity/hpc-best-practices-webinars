Seth Johnson specializes in high-performance computational radiation transport as a research staff member at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Although his background is in nuclear engineering, with a B.S. from Texas A&M University and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, he finds himself researching software advancements more than performing traditional engineering analyses. Over his career, Seth has developed new methods and tools in hybrid deterministicâ€“Monte Carlo transport, computational geometry, sensitivity/uncertainty methods, automated inter-language code binding, and high-energy physics.
