    - *Note: these are actually Markdown files, but Jekyll insists on
       giving them an html extension.  To see something that will make
       more sense, you should "view page source" for these pages in
       your broswer.  In many browsers, the shortcut is crtl-u.
       Otherwise, it can usually be found on the context (right-click)
       menu for the page.*
