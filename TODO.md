# Items to do

- HTML title metadata derived from filename.  Probable better choices
- What's up with navigation???
- look for useful HTML5 (or other) semantic tags
- Do something more intelligent when the webinar presenter-id doesn't match a presenter.  Right now, it causes Jekyll to error out.
- Webinars with a future date are **ignored** by the collection unless `future: true` is set in _config.yml (or jekyll is invoked with --future)
- Additional bios within details tags are not being markdownified
- Decide whether we want to expose aka names, past affiliations, past bios
- Incorporation of presenter bios into webinar pages includes past bios because past bios are merely part of the presenter content.  This is probably not desirable in the long run.
