Scientific code developers have increasingly been adopting software
processes derived from the mainstream (non-scientific) community.
Software practices are typically adopted when continuing without them
becomes impractical. However, many software best practices need
modification and/or customization, partly because the codes are used
for research and exploration, and partly because of the combined
funding and sociological challenges. This presentation will describe
the lifecycle of scientific software and important ways in which it
differs from other software development.  We will provide a
compilation of software engineering best practices that have generally
been found to be useful by science communities, and we will provide
guidelines for adoption of practices based on the size and the scope
of the project.
