This talk will provide an overview of the work at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory to re-vamp our open source project offerings,
release processes, and engagements across the Department of Energy and
the US government through efforts such as DOECode and Code.gov. We
will also discuss ongoing work to make it easier for our staff to
engage with open source communities, via both the creation of new
projects and contributions to existing open source projects.  We
believe that these experiences and insights may be useful to a wide
range of developers of high-performance scientific software.
