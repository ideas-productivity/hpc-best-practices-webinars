In this webinar, we will begin by introducing the Roofline Model and
its “Cache-Aware” variant. We will proceed with some general
guidelines and historical approaches to Roofline-based program
analysis. Next, we will provide a short discussion of how changes in
data locality and arithmetic intensity of two canonical benchmarks
visually manifest in the context of these two Roofline
formulations. Subsequently, we will provide two demonstrations of
using Intel Advisor and the Roofline model within Intel Advisor. The
first demo will be primarily instructive on how to compile, benchmark,
and use Advisor. The second demo will focus on using variants of a
simple benchmark to highlight changes in the Roofline model as well as
providing correlation to Advisor’s other capabilities. We will
conclude with a few comments on future directions.
