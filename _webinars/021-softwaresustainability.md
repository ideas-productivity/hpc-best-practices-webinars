How do you make software sustainable? How much is it about process and
how much about practice? Does it vary between countries or
disciplines? In this webinar, I’ll present what the UK’s Software
Sustainability Institute has learned from 8 years of work in this area
including efforts around understanding the scale of software use in
research, raising the profile of software as a key part of the
research ecosystem, and how we can enable researchers and developers
to build better software.
