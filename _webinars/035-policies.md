The development of increasingly complex architectures and software
ecosystems continues. Both the multiphysics modeling simulations and
the coupling of modeling and data analytics applications increasingly
require the combined use of software packages developed by diverse,
independent teams throughout the HPC community. The Extreme-scale
ScientiÔ¨Åc Software Development Kit (xSDK) is being developed to
provide such an infrastructure of independent mathematical libraries
to support productive and efficient development of high-quality
applications. This webinar will discuss in more detail the development
and impact of the xSDK community policies, which constitute and
integral part of the project and were defined to achieve improved code
quality and compatibility across xSDK member packages and a
sustainable software ecosystem.
