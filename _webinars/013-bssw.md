Better Scientific Software (BSSw) is an organization dedicated to
improving developer productivity and software sustainability for
computational science and engineering (CSE).  This presentation will
introduce a new website (<https://bssw.io>)—a community exchange for
scientific software improvement.  We’re creating a clearinghouse to
gather, discuss, and disseminate experiences, techniques, tools, and
other resources to improve software productivity and sustainability
for CSE. Site users can find information on scientific software topics
and can propose to curate or create new content based on their own
experiences. The backend enables collaborative content development
using standard GitHub tools and processes.  We need your contributions
to build the BSSw site into a vibrant resource, with content and
editorial processes provided by volunteers throughout the
international CSE community.  Join us!
