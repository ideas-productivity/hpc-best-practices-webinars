This presentation will emphasize intermediate-level tutorial and
reference information about the Git version control (VC) system. This
overview takes the view that the best way to learn to use Git
effectively is to learn it as a data structure and a set of algorithms
to manipulate that data structure. This perspective is important
because the Git command-line interface is widely considered to be
overly complex and confusing. For example, a Git command like
‘checkout’ can do wildly different things depending on the other
arguments passed into the command or the state of the Git repository.
But Git is still the dominant VC system; many people consider that Git
has won the version control wars due to its power and flexibility.
