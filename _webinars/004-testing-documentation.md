Software verification and validation are needed for high-quality and
reliable scientific codes. For software with moderate to long
lifecycles, a strong automated testing regime is indispensable for
continued reliability. Similarly, comprehensive and comprehensible
documentation is vital for code maintenance and extensibility. This
presentation will provide guidelines on testing and documentation that
can help to ensure high-quality and long-lived HPC software. We will
present methodologies, with examples, for developing tests and
adopting regular automated testing. We also will provide guidelines
for minimum, adequate, and good documentation practices depending on
the available resources of the development team.
