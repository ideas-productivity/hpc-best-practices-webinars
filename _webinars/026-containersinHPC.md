Containers have gained adoption in the HPC and scientific computing
space through specialized runtimes like Shifter, Singularity and
Charliecloud. Containers enable reproducible, shareable, portable
execution of applications. In this webinar, we will give a brief
introduction on how to build images and run containers on HPC
systems. We will also discuss some best practices to ensure containers
can take full advantage of HPC systems.
