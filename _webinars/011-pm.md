presenter-ids: [heroux-michael-011]

Software development is an essential activity for many scientific
teams.  Modeling, simulation and data analysis, using team-developed
software, are increasing valuable for scientific discovery and
engineering. Many teams use informal, ad hoc approaches for managing
their software efforts.  While sufficient for many efforts, a modest
emphasis on team models and processes can substantially improve
developer productivity and software sustainability. In this
presentation, we discuss several light-weight techniques for managing
scientific software efforts.  Using checklists, policy statements and
a Kanban workflow system, we emphasize techniques for managing the
initiation and exit of team members, approaches to synthesizing team
culture, and ways to improve communication within a team and with its
stakeholders.
