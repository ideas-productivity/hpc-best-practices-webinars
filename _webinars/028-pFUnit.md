Over the past two decades, the emergence of highly effective software
testing frameworks has greatly simplified the development and use of
unit tests and has led to new software development paradigms such as
test driven development (TDD). However, technical computing introduces
a number of unique testing challenges, including distributed
parallelism and numerical accuracy. This webinar will begin with a
basic introduction to the use of pFUnit to develop tests for
MPI+Fortran software and then present some of the new capabilities in
the latest release. We will also discuss some specialized
methodologies for testing numerical algorithms and speculate about
future framework capabilities that may improve our ability to test at
exascale.
