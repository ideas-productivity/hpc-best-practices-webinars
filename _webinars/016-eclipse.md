The Eclipse IDE is one of the most popular IDEs available, and its
support for multiple languages, particularly C, C++ and Fortran has
made it the go to IDE for scientific software development. Although an
IDE like Eclipse can provide advanced development capabilities such as
code recommendation and refactoring, these features can be difficult
to utilize for complex code bases. Other challenges, such as ease of
installation and use, reliability, and compatibility with existing
development practices also play a role. Ultimately the usefulness of
the tool is a tradeoff between the capabilities it provides and the
challenges of incorporating it into the development workflow. This
webinar will demonstrate some of the latest features available in
Eclipse that are particularly useful for scientific application
development, and examine how they can be used in a variety of
different scenarios using realistic sample codes.
