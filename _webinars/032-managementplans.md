Software is a necessary by-product of research. Software in this
context can range from small shell scripts to complex and layered
software ecosystems. Dealing with software as a first class citizen at
the time of grant formulation is aided by the development of a
Software Management Plan (SMP). An SMP can help to formalize a set of
structures and goals that ensure your software is accessible and
reusable in the short, medium and long term. SMP’s aim at becoming for
software what Data Management Plans (DMP’s) have become for research
data (DMP’s are mandatory for National Science Foundation
grants). This webinar takes you through the questions you should
consider when developing a Software Management Plan, how to manage the
implementation of the plan, and some of the current motivation driving
discussion in this area of research management.
