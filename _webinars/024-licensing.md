Software licensing and related matters of intellectual property can
often seem confusing or hopelessly complicated, especially when many
present their opinions as dogma. This presentation takes a different
approach: getting you to think about software licensing from the
standpoint of what you want others to be able to do (or not do) with
your software. We will start by developing a common understanding of
the terminology used around software licenses. Then we’ll consider
various scenarios of what you might want to accomplish with a software
license, and what to look for in the license. We’ll also discuss some
pragmatic issues around actually applying a license to your
software. A list of resources will be provided to help with further
exploration of these topics.
