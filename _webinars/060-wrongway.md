Large scale computing systems such as those deployed and being deployed at U.S. Department of Energy computing facilities rely greatly on compute accelerators (currently graphics processing units, GPUs) for their performance potential. Each of these systems has a small number of natural approaches for representing the code that runs on these accelerators. For instance, for the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility’s Frontier system, the natural approaches include the Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability (HIP) and OpenMP with target offload. But it is often interesting, and sometimes even useful, to consider the impact of using a “wrong” programming approach for a given system. In this webinar, the speaker will present a few of these “wrong” programming approaches for current and near-term future systems, including a discussion of the specific software packages that enable the approach, and lessons learned in cases where the approach has been attempted.
