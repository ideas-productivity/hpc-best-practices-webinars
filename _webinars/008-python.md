Pythonâ€™s powerful elegance has driven its adoption at HPC centers for
job orchestration, visualization, exploratory data analysis, and even
simulation.  But maximizing performance from Python applications can
be challenging especially on supercomputing architectures.  This
webinar will explain those challenges with a practical emphasis on
using Python at NERSC, ALCF, and OLCF.  We will outline a variety of
performance optimization strategies, tools for measuring and
addressing performance problems, and establish best practices for
Python in HPC.
