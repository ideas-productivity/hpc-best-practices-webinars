title: "Bringing Best Practices to  a Long-Lived Production Code"
presenter-ids: [ferenbaugh-charles]
---
How can you introduce best software practices to a long-lived
scientific production code, with a significant user base, that has
“gotten along fine” for years doing things its own way? Often
developers in such projects must struggle with overly complex code,
inadequate documentation, little or no software process, and a “just
write the code fast” culture; these are challenges to software quality
that are generally not issues for new projects. In this presentation
we’ll discuss some of the peculiar problems faced by long-lived
scientific codes, and present a case study of how we’re dealing with
these issues at LANL in the xRage radiation-hydrodynamics simulation
code.
