The Kokkos C++ Performance Portability Ecosystem is a production-level solution for writing modern C++ applications in an hardware-agnostic way. It is part of the US Department of Energy’s Exascale Computing Project—the leading effort in the US to prepare the HPC community for the next generation of supercomputing platforms. Kokkos is now used by more than a hundred HPC projects, and Kokkos-based codes are running regularly at-scale on at least five of the top ten supercomputers in the world. In this webinar, we will give a short overview of what the Kokkos Ecosystem provides, including its programming model, math kernels library, tools, and training resources, before providing an overview of the Kokkos team’s efforts surrounding the ISO-C++ standard, and how Kokkos both influences future standards and aligns with developments occurring in them. The webinar will include a status update on the progress in supporting the upcoming exascale class HPC systems announced by DOE.
