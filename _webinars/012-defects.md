Software Quality Engineering (SQE) and methods research and scientific
investigation are often thought to be incompatible.  However, in
reality they are not only compatible, but required in order to have
confidence in the results of even basic scientific computations.  This
is especially true for parallel software.  In this talk we will look
at methods for performing software verification.  Software
verification is a method for removing defects at code construction
time; these techniques can help in both algorithm and method
development, as well as increased productivity.
