Current approaches used in computational and data science research may
require significant time without necessarily advancing scientific
understanding. For example, researchers may spend countless hours
reformatting data and writing code to attempt to reproduce previously
published research. What if the scientific community could find a
better way to create and publish workflows, data, and models that are
easy to reproduce, thus streamlining scientific analysis? Popper is a
protocol and command language interpreter (CLI) tool for implementing
scientific exploration pipelines following a DevOps approach of
unifying software development and operation in order to handle
complexity in large codebases. Popper repurposes DevOps practices in
the context of scientific explorations, so that researchers can
leverage existing tools and technologies to enable
reproducibility. This webinar will introduce the Popper protocol,
including a demo of the CLI tool and HPC examples.
