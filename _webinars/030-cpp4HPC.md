title: Modern C++ for High-Performance Computing
author: Andrew Lumsdaine (PNNL and University of Washington)
---
Since its creation by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s, C++ has
steadily evolved to become a multi-paradigm programming language that
fully supports the needs of modern programmers. Because C++ had its
roots in the C programming language, conventional wisdom (and
longstanding practice) had been to use C++ in a dichotomous fashion:
abstractions for productivity with escape to C for
performance. However, C++ today is best viewed holistically — as it is
today — rather than as extension of C or even of earlier versions of
C++. In this webinar I will give a tour of features from modern C++
relevant to HPC, along with guidelines for their use — and demonstrate
that C++ can offer productivity and elegance while sacrificing nothing
in performance.
